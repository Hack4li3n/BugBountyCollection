# Bug Bounty Collection

Welcome to **BugBountyCollection** ‚Äî a personal knowledge base and collection of resources that I‚Äôve gathered while learning, practicing, and exploring the world of **bug bounty hunting and web application security**.  

This repository is **not an exploit toolkit** ‚Äî rather, it‚Äôs a **reference hub** to help me (and hopefully others) quickly recall concepts, payloads, and best practices while testing applications for vulnerabilities.  


## Disclaimer
This repository is created **for educational and self-learning purposes only**.  
The techniques, payloads, and notes here are meant to:
- Help me learn web security  
- Serve as quick references while practicing on **legal platforms** (HackTheBox, PortSwigger Labs, TryHackMe, etc.)  
- Document useful resources I find online  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not use this information for unauthorized testing or exploitation.** Always practice responsible disclosure and follow the laws of your jurisdiction.


## üìñ References
I actively rely on and learn from:
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/)  
- [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)  
- [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/)  
- [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)  
- Community write-ups, blog posts, and CTF challenges  

## ‚úçNotes
This repo will grow over time as I explore more vulnerability classes, tools, and real-world case studies.  
Think of it as my **cybersecurity notebook made public** üìù.  

If you stumble upon this repo and find it useful ‚Äî awesome! üöÄ  
If you have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or PR.
